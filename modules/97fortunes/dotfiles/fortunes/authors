"The message that I was getting as a kid in our house...was that every word that you choose and
where you say it and to whom is of utmost importance in that enterprise of fixing the world. And
that it's beyond important to speak the truth. And the fact that the truth is not always easy
to get to or recognize â€” that's your work."
    - Elisabeth Le Guin (daughter of Ursula K. Le Guin)

Me, talking a writer down from imposter syndrome: How long have you been writing?
Them: Three years.
Me: And how old are you?
Them: 28.
Me: Okay. So you're a level 28 human and a level 3 writer. How good were you as a level 3 human?
Them: Ooooooooh.
