The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause,

But this tomfoolery, having passed through a very expensive machine,

"In my life I have found two things of priceless worth - learning and 
loving.  Nothing else - not fame, not power, not achievement for its own 
sake - can possibly have the same lasting value.  For when your life is 
over, if you can say 'I have learned' and 'I have loved,' you will also 
be able to say 'I have been happy.' "

Friendship is not diminished by distance or time... by suffering or silence.

	A page is turned by the wind to a boy in curly grin
	With a world to conquer at the age of ten
	But as history unfolds and the storybook is told
	He finds salvation but not at the hands of man

	And the God of second chance 
	Picked him up and He let him dance
	Through a world that is not kind
	And all this time, preparing him the one
	To hold him up when he comes undone
	Beneath the storm, beneath the sun
	And now a man, here you stand
	Your day has come

	A page is turned in this world to reveal a little girl
	With a heart that's bigger, as it is unfurled
	By the language in her soul, that's teaching her to grow
	With a careful cover of love that will not fail

	And the God of second chance
	Picked her up and He let her dance
	Through a world that isn't kind
	And all this time, preparing her the one
	To hold her up when she comes undone
	Beneath the storm, beneath the sun
	And grown up tall, here you are
	Your day has come

	Beneath the air of autumn, she took him by his hand
	And warm within the ardor, she took his heart instead
	And high upon the mountain, he asked her for her hand
	Just for her hand

	A page is turned in this life, he's making her his wife
	And there is no secret to the source of this much life
	When the grace that falls like rain is washing them again
	Just a chance to somehow rise above this land

	Where the God of second chance
	Will pick them up and He'll let them dance
	Through a world that is not kind
	And all this time, they're sharing with the one
	That holds them up when they've come undone
	Beneath the storm, beneath the sun
	And once again, here you stand
	And once again, here you stand
	Your day has come

        To laugh is to risk appearing a fool,
        To weep is to risk appearing sentimental.
        To reach out to another is to risk involvement,
        To expose feelings is to risk exposing your true self.
        To place your ideas and dreams before a crowd is to risk their loss.

        To love is to risk not being loved in return,
        To live is to risk dying,
        To hope is to risk despair,
        To try is to risk failure.

        But risks must be taken because the greatest   hazard in life is to risk nothing.
        The person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing, is nothing.

        He may avoid suffering and sorrow,
        But he cannot learn, feel, change, grow or live.

        Chained by his servitude he is a slave who has forfeited all freedom.
        Only a person who risks is free.

        The pessimist complains about the wind;
        The optimist expects it to change;
        And the realist adjusts the sails.

                - "Risk", William Arthur Ward

	And so they would go on, apart or together as love and chance and

"alas my love you say goodbye
wipe the poison from my brow
alas my love this guilty night
it gives me up like a foster child
and in the moment i take my vow
these angels sleeping at my feet
and in this moment you do not know how
my spirit wants to flee."

One man, against the night
taking on a multitude
that had left him high and dry
no cangle burning vigil
could light the way,
darkness hit the ground
like a fallen satellite
he wrestled until morning
with human souls
and dark angels
and finished his work
on the third day


remember...

Comment scrawled in the dirt
For the pity-boy cowered in hurt
Of a bridge that instead is burning
And a new boy that instead is learning
That it's harder sometimes to be than not
And it's easier forgiven than forgot
He says it's by the tree that you have died
It's by the tree that you're alive

Tread lightly to the music,
Nor bruise the tender grass,
Life passes in the weather
As the sand storms down the glass.
Drift easy in the shadows,
Bask lazy in the sun,
Give thanks for thirsts and quenches,
For dines, and wines and wenches,
Give thought to life soon over,
Tread softly on the clover,
So bruise not any lover.
So exit from the living,
Salute and make thanksgiving,
Then sleep when all is done,
That sleep so dearly won.

If you are a dreamer, a wisher, a liar,

For we have some flax-golden tales to spin.
Come in!
Come in!
