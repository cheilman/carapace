# !!! DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT THE SSH CONFIG FOR YOUR USER !!!
#
# Your user's ssh config is managed by Carapace.  Any changes you make manually may be discarded.
# You may create a local module in ~/.host/modules that contains a ssh_config, and it will be
# automatically included in a rebuild of the system (or manually kicked off by carapace-install).
