# !!! DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT THE GITCONFIG FOR YOUR USER !!!

# Your user's gitconfig is managed by Carapace.  Any changes you make manually may be discarded.
# You may create a local module in ~/.host/modules that contains a gitconfig, and it will be
# automatically included in a rebuild of the system (or manually kicked off by carapace-install).
