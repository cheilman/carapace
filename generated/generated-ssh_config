# !!! DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT THE SSH CONFIG FOR YOUR USER !!!

# Your user's ssh config is managed by Carapace.  Any changes you make manually may be discarded.
# You may create a local file (~/.host/ssh_config) that will be automatically included in a rebuild of
# the system (or manually kicked off by carapace-install).
