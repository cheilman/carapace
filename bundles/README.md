Carapace Bundles
================

Here are some example bundles that you might want to clone here:

- [carapace-busybox](https://github.com/cheilman/carapace-busybox) -- Adds busybox to the carapace system and uses it to implement some utilities that aren't installed on the host system.
- [carapace-laptop](https://github.com/cheilman/carapace-laptop) -- Laptop related utliities (i3, fonts, etc.).  Not really just for laptops, but intended for any system you're sitting in front of.
- [carapace-docker](https://github.com/cheilman/carapace-docker) -- Docker utilities and container-based programs. NOTE: not implemented, tested or currently used.

Feel free to create your own!  A common usage is to create a company-based bundle that's stored in a company-only git repo, that isolates any propriatary details.
