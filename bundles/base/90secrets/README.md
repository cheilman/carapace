# Secrets!

Be **super** careful about what you commit into this repo.  Seriously, think
thrice about it.

## public/

Anything in here is expected to be extremly public -- if everyone in the world
can see it that's fine.  Things like asymmetric public keys.

## secrets/

Things in here **must be encrypted**, and the means of decrypting them **must
not be in this repo**.
